### ⚠️ Modified Version

This is a modified version of ZaneyOS. To get it working, please look through the files and figure it out.

#### 🍖 Requirements

- You must be running on NixOS.

  in the top bar.

#### 🏇 Optimized Workflow & Simple Yet Elegant Neovim

- Using Hyprland for increased elegance, functionality, and effeciency.
- No massive Neovim project here. This is my simple, easy to understand, yet
  incredible Neovim setup.

#### 🖥️ Multi Host & User Configuration

- You can define separate settings for different host machines and users.
- Easily specify extra packages for your users in the modules/core/user.nix
  file.
- Easy to understand file structure and simple, but encompassing,
  configuratiion.
